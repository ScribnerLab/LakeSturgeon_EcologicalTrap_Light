This file includes the data used for “Experimental evidence indicates lake sturgeon are susceptible to an ecological trap.” This data includes results and covaiates of raceway trials in which larval lake sturgeon were released in a stream-like mesocosm contianing two predatory rock bass individuals. Lake sturgeeon larvae were released along with Heptageniid mayfly larvae and white sucker larvae. The number of larvae released, light level of the mesocosm during the trial, and the temperature at which the lake sturgeon larvae were reared (influencing length of the larvae) varied among trials. Either 32 individuals of all three larval taxa were released during one hour trials (high density) or 8 individuals of all taxa (low density), reflective of observed variation in drifting larvae in a natural system. The light level was set to either 0.20 lux, indicative of a full moon, or 0.00 lux to reflect new moon light condiditons. Lake sturgeon larvae were reared in a hatchery at 10°C or 18°C at the egg and yolk-sac larval stages before being used in raceway trials at the beginning of the larval stage. Lake sturgeon released in any given trial were full siblings and several different families were used across trials. 
Each row of the csv file indicates a unique trial. 
Here is an explanation of each column in the csv file:

•	Trial number: Unique number given to each trial.
•	Family: Unique number assigned to each family. Trials that have the same family number indicate all larvae in those trials were full siblings. 
•	Temp: The temperature (°C) in which the lake sturgeon in the trial were reared.
•	Lux: The light level (lux) of the raceway during the trial. 
•	Density: The density of larvae released. A 1 here indicates 32 individuals of each taxa were released over the course of the trial and 2 indicates 8 individuals of each were released.
•	Strugeon.surv: The proportion of lake sturgeon larvae that survived the trial. 
•	Heptageniid.surv: The proportion of Heptageniid mayfly larvae that survived the trial.
•	Catostomid.surv: The proportion of white sucker larvae that survived the trial.
•	Strugeon: The number of lake sturgeon larvae that survived the trial. 
•	Heptageniid: The number of Heptageniid mayfly larvae that survived the trial.
•	Catostomid: The number of white sucker larvae that survived the trial.
